ENDPOINTS:

/user/signup(POST)
/user/balance (GET)
/user/debit (GET) //TO trigger the debit notification

Testing the endpoints:
1. Before anything can be tested you have to create a dummy account by simply 
accessing the "/user/signup" as its the userId of this user you'll be using to test the endpoints ( E.G http://localhost:3000/api/user/signup)
 (The endpoint returns the user object on purpose so u can see the user Id as it is needed to trigger the notif ).
It should contain a body (username, email, phone, password) 


2.Once logged in youll have access to the endpoints 
/user/balance (GET) (To get the balance of the current user from the wallet service)


/user/debit (GET):
 It takes 3 query params (user, amountToDeduct, notifType), (check the console for the userId)
 notifType should be between email and mobile for custom notification
 Amount is the amout that will be deducted from the user's balance (450)


 /user/credit (PUT):
 It takes 3 query params  "user"(the databaseId), "amountToAdd" and "notifType"
 To confirm that the amount has been added u can retrieve the balance of that particlar user
